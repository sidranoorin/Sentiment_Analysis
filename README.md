# Sentiment_Analysis
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis on customer reviews from the Swiggy food delivery platform using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The goal of this project is to classify customer reviews as positive or negative, based on the provided ratings. We will be using TensorFlow to build and train the RNN model.The project includes building the model using Keras, preprocessing the data, and training the model to classify sentiment from text.

Introduction
Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone of a piece of text. In this project, we will be using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sentiment analysis, which is well-suited for sequential data like text. RNNs are ideal for tasks where the sequence and order of words in a sentence carry significant meaning, making them a powerful tool for sentiment classification.
In this project, we apply Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews of the Swiggy food delivery platform. The task involves classifying reviews as either positive or negative, which provides insights into customer satisfaction.

Libraries and Dataset
We will use the following libraries for this project:
numpy: For numerical operations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
re: For regular expressions to clean the text data.
sklearn: For splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
tensorflow: For building and training the RNN model.

Conclusion
In this project, we successfully implemented a Sentiment Analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). By preprocessing the data, building the RNN model, and training it on labeled reviews, we were able to predict whether a review is positive or negative.
